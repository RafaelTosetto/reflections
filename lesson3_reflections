When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To keep a safe copy, as a backup of my files, in cloud; or if I use a public computer, as in my college, for instance, I shall not let any files locally.
Also, to keep every file centralized in one place that several developers are working at a shared or public project.

Q1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To keep a safe copy, as a backup of my files, in cloud; or if I use a public computer, as in my college, for instance, I shall not let any files locally.
Also, to keep every file centralized in one place that several developers are working at a shared or public project.

Q2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than havin 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So I can choose the files I want to become avaliable publicly.

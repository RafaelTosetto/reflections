Q1 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To keep a safe copy, as a backup of my files, in cloud; or if I use a public computer, as in my college, for instance, I shall not let any files locally.
Also, to keep every file centralized in one place that several developers are working at a shared or public project.

Q2 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than havin 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So I can choose the files I want to become avaliable publicly.

Q3 - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?
Fork differs from the others because it is a feature only Github related.
Clones is only used in our local machine to copy data from a repository in Github.
Branch is only a space where files are stored in either Github and/or locally. It could be used to separate the files you want to public, as a measure to control what will be visible to everyone.
